// The Dockerfile contains everything needed to install the backend project as well all its
// dependencies, exposing the gate as well as the entrypoint.



// After creating the image we run a container with it and bind its port 8000 to hosts
// port 8000 and its log file "backend-docker-example/logs.txt" to the precreated logs.txt
// file in the folder the container is run from by using the following command:

docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd)/logs.txt:/backend-example-docker/logs.txt backend-example-docker



// Then, as we can see, the logs.txt in the folder the container was run from contain
// the logs that were logged in the container. These logs (also included in the exercise
// folder) were created in two different runs to make sure the latter run included the
// logging of the first run as well.
