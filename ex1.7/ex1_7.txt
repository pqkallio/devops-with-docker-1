// The Dockerfiles for front- and backend are in their respective folders.
// The commands in them have been modified as was suggested in the exercise.

// After building the images, I started the backend with the following command:

docker run -p 8000:8000 1_7_backend


// and the frontend with the following command:

docker run -p 5000:5000 1_7_frontend


// I navigated to frontend application in the browser and hit the test button.
// Everything was ok and the network logs of the developer tools showed that
// message was sent to localhost:8000/ping and the response was pong with a
// statuscode 200.
