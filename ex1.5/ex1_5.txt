// I incorporated the retrieval and building of the web application
// into the building process of the image (check the Dockerfile).

// After this, when running the container and binding the port like this:
pqkallio@fuxi16:~/devops-with-docker/week1/ex1.5$ docker run -p 5000:5000 frontend-example-docker

// I got the following output:
INFO: Accepting connections at http://localhost:5000

// And when navigating to that address from the browser, the page appeared
// with the following text:
Exercise 1.4: Congratulations! You configured your ports correctly!
